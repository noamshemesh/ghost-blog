            <p><em>and still work 8 hours</em></p>

<p>​I know, the number of lines-of-code (LOC) is not the most important performance indicator. It might be even one of the <em>least</em> important indicators.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons for this. First, 10 good lines are by far preferred over 1000 lousy and poorly written lines. </p>

<p>Second, no two programming languages are the same, and 10 LOC in a modern, less-strict language like Python or JavaScript could be equivalent to 100 LOC in a traditional, more-verbose language like Java or C++.</p>

<p>The number of LOC is important as a relative performance indicator, when compared in the scope of the same language. Besides, everyone agrees that writing <em>good</em> 1k is better than <em>good</em> 100 lines.</p>

<p>Here's how to do it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The obvious and most basic rule is to <strong>write fast</strong>. Try beating 50 WPM in <a href="http://play.typeracer.com/">typeracer</a>. <br>
Now develop in 50 WPM - That's 24,000 words a day, assuming 10 words/line give 2400 LOC a day. We even have some time left over for research and to find libraries to reuse before writing a new piece of code :)</p></li>
<li><p>Another basic tip is to <strong>avoid interruptions</strong>. Meetings, notifications, emails, slack, facebook. Get a good pair of noise cancelling headphones and start tracking time - there are many <a href="https://blog.hubstaff.com/best-mac-time-tracking-apps/">time tracking applications</a> to help you track the progress. </p></li>
<li><p>Learn <strong>IDE tricks</strong>. Especially in languages that are considered verbose where there is a lot to write, and in strong typed languages where the IDE has much more understanding of what's going on.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">Learn <strong>Regular Expressions</strong></a>. A good example for an IDE trick is to use find and replace properly, sure you can go over all the functions that start with <code>func</code> and with <code>var1</code> as parameter and change it to <code>run</code> manually. Though a better and faster option would be to find <code>func([\w]*\(var1)</code> and replace it with <code>run$1</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don't write bugs</strong>. Seriously. Debugging is one of the most time-consuming tasks. Think about that graph on how much it cost to fix bugs in different level of development - The lowest cost is before even writing the bugs. <br>
How to do that:  </p>

<ul><li>Learn the language caveats and avoid them  </li>
<li>Read a library documentation before using it</li>
<li>Use the library the way it supposed to be used </li>
<li>Understand what's happening underneath</li>
<li>Copy and paste wisely. I know a guy that always say: <em>In every copy and paste there is a bug</em>.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Mark some <strong>checkpoints</strong> for yourself. Parents are more productive when they know they must go home at specific hour and finish the tasks before leaving (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/30/study-women-with-more-children-are-more-productive-at-work/">ref</a>). <br>
I like to mark short-term checkpoints. For example, continue working on the standing desk until a specific task is finished, or drink coffee only after I finish writing a specific document.</p></li>
</ol>
