<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/noamsh/brian.jpg" alt="Brian the dog">
Anyway, last year we got a dog. When I don't take him to work with me, he stays at home doing some dog stuff, and I wanted to spy on him.</p>

<p>While assessing the options, I saw a lot of 100$+ cameras that can detect motion in the house and upload the recorded clip to the cloud.</p>

<p>I thought that this is a cool option, but where is the challenge? <br>
Luckily, I got the honor to work with <a href="http://erikzaadi.com/">Erik Zaadi</a>, the man and the Raspberry Pi. He heard that I'm considering to buy a camera and told me about <a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome"><code>motion</code></a> linux package. <br>
There it is, the challenge.</p>

<p>So, instead of going out for a beer I started working on this. First, the expectations:</p>

<ol>
<li>Record on a movement</li>
<li>Auto turn on/turn off</li>
<li>Upload recording to cloud</li>
<li>See live feed</li>
<li>To be able to tell our dog to get off the couch</li>
</ol>

<p>After getting the dust off my Raspberry, I found out that the first issue got solved very quickly with aforementioned <code>motion</code> package. I <code>apt-get</code>ed it, set some <a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/MotionGuideBasicFeatures">configurations</a> related to the lightening in my house, and it worked. </p>

<p>Worked is an understatement, as it kept on filming us while at home. <br>
In order to get back our privacy, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/noamshemesh/motion-starter">tiny (and hacky) module</a> that waits for <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code> commands. Later my girlfriend moved in and I added some code to make sure that the camera will turn on only if both of us call <code>start</code>.</p>

<p>To call these commands from everywhere, I use <a href="http://www.noip.com/">noip.com</a> that integrated with my router, which keeps my ip up-to-date with noip.com services, and expose the wanted services with <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/">nginx</a>. <br>
What now? GPS, WiFi or Bluetooth? Well, I started with GPS Geo fencing, and it didn't work well. Now we use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=AutomateIt.mainPackage">AutomateIt</a> to watch our WiFi connection and work accordingly (off when connected, on when disconnected)</p>

<p>Ok, so we have recordings of movements, and they don't contain us. Next thing is to upload them to a cloud service. <br>
After I ran into a nice module called <a href="https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader">Dropbox-Uploader</a>, I thought that it's probably going to be the simplest way to upload the recordings, and set it up. <br>
Simple script that uploads the files and then deletes them, call it every minute with <code>crontab</code>, and we have it.</p>

<p>I wanted to spy on my dog when he eats his bone, and not a minute later, and to get the live feed was actually pretty easy as we set almost everything up. <br>
All that needed to be done was to wire <code>nginx</code> to the local <code>motion</code> feed and get to it with the previously set <code>noip.com</code> address. </p>

<p>Last thing I want to do is to be able to speak with my dog (he doesn't have to answer). That's my next task. I'm considering to use <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/">HTML5 microphone support</a> to send the data to the Raspberry and to play it immediately after it receives it. Any ideas?</p>
